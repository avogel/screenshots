backbone useage:

use restful http to update storage of info


collection (list of models): add, remove, reset events

view: owns a DOM object.  has render method.


Model View Binding: (not automatic) done in initialize method of a view.  "this.model.on('change', this.render, this")";

router: routes url to javascript code.
history: observes URI changes and fires callback


To Consider: change how collections in Mongodb are used to get older and newer pictures at once
